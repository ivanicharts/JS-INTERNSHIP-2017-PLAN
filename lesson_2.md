#### <i class="icon-star"></i> Data types
JavaScript has typed values, not typed variables. Here you need to understand differences between 6 data types of JavaScript.

*Overall questions:*

 1. Enumerate build-in JavaScript data types
 2. What is a `typeof` operator? What bugs does it have?
 3. What is difference between `1` and `'1'`?
 4. Explain *Converting Between Types* in JavaScript

#### <i class="icon-star"></i> Basic operators: +, -, ++, --, %, =, ‘,’
To work with variables, with values, JavaScript supports all standard operators, most of which are in other programming languages. We know several operators from school - these are ordinary addition `+`, multiplication `*`, subtraction `-`, and so on.
In this chapter, we will concentrate on operators that do not pass the mathematics course, and on their features in JavaScript.

*Overall questions:*

 1. Enumerate basic operators in JavaScript
 2. Explain difference between `a++` and `++a`?
 3. What is *execution priority*?

#### <i class="icon-star"></i> Comparison and Boolean operators
There are quite a few ways we can express conditionals (aka decisions) in our programs.
The most common one is the if statement. Essentially, you're saying, "If this condition is `true`, do the following...".

*Overall questions:*

 1. What is *types coercion* in JavaScript?
 2. Enumerate list of *falsy* values in JavaScript
 3. Enumerate list of *truthy* values in JavaScript
 4. How many *equality* and *inequality* operators do you know?
 5. What do you can say about *strings comparison*?

#### <i class="icon-star"></i> Loops
When writing scripts, it is usual task to do the same type of action many times.
For example, withdraw products from the list one by one. Or just sort through all the numbers from 1 to 10 and for each execute the same code. For repeated execution of one section of the code - loops are provided.

*Overall questions:*

 1. Enumerate build-in JavaScript loops
 2. In `for` loop inside the parentheses we have three items, separated by semi-colons. Enumerate and describe them.
 3. What is *iteration* and how to skip iterations in JavaScript?
 4. What can you say about loops in loops and what is *loop labels*?
 5. What is `break`?
 6. How to crash browser using simple loop?
