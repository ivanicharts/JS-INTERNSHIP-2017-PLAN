Lesson 1 - Basics, types, vars, loops, operators, comparison
------------------------------------------------------------


Hey! Here is your first lesson. We are hoping that you'll be strong on your way to become a JavaScript guru.
In this lesson you'll learn: main principles of JavaScript. You'll find out how to create variables and which data types they can store. After that you'll learn basic operators and how to use them. Also you'll learn comparisons in JavaScript and how to loop all of that stuff!

----------

#### <i class="icon-star"></i> Main principles
First of all you need to understand what is JavaScript, what problems does it solve and when you need to use JavaScript and when you don't need it.

*What you'll learn:*

 1. Describe 3 main technologies which are used in browsers.
 2. What is JavaScript?
 3. Which problems does it solve?
 4. Which platforms can "understand" JavaScript?
 5. Difference between interpreted and compiled code?

#### <i class="icon-star"></i> Variables
Depending on what you are doing, you will need to work with the information.
If it's a store - then it's goods, or a basket. If it's a chat app - visitors, messages and so on.
To store information, *variables* are used.

*What you'll learn:*

 1. What is a variable?
 2. Which characters can contain **var** name?
 3. What is hoisting?

#### <i class="icon-star"></i> Data types
JavaScript has typed values, not typed variables. Here you need to understand differences between 6 data types of JavaScript.

*What you'll learn:*

 1. Enumerate build-in JavaScript data types
 2. What is a `typeof` operator? What bugs does it have?
 3. What is difference between `1` and `'1'`?
 4. Explain *Converting Between Types* in JavaScript

#### <i class="icon-star"></i> Basic operators: +, -, ++, --, %, =, ‘,’
To work with variables and with values, JavaScript supports all standard operators, most of which are used in other programming languages. You may know several operators from school - these are ordinary addition `+`, multiplication `*`, subtraction `-`, and so on.
In this chapter, you will concentrate on operators that are used for mathematical purposes, also what you can do with those operators in JavaScript.

*What you'll learn:*

 1. Enumerate basic operators in JavaScript
 2. Explain difference between `a++` and `++a`?
 3. What is *execution priority*?

#### <i class="icon-star"></i> Comparison and Boolean operators
There are quite a few ways you can express conditionals (aka decisions) in your programs.
The most common one is the if statement. Essentially, you're saying, "If this condition is `true`, do the following...".

*What you'll learn:*

 1. What is *types coercion* in JavaScript?
 2. Enumerate list of *falsy* values in JavaScript
 3. Enumerate list of *truthy* values in JavaScript
 4. How many *equality* and *inequality* operators do you know?
 5. What can you say about *strings comparison*?

#### <i class="icon-star"></i> Loops
When writing scripts, it is common task to do the same type of action many times.
For example, withdraw products from the list one by one. Or just sort through all the numbers from 1 to 10 and for each execute the same code. For repeated execution of one section of the code - loops are provided.

*What you'll learn:*

 1. Enumerate build-in JavaScript loops
 2. In `for` loop inside the parentheses you have three items, separated by semi-colons. Enumerate and describe them.
 3. What is *iteration* and how to skip iterations in JavaScript?
 4. What can you say about loops and what is *loop labels*?
 5. What is `break`?
 6. How to crash browser using simple loop?
