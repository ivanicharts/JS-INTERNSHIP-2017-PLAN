Lesson 6 - “this”, descriptors, getters, setters, context
------------------------------------------------------------


In this lesson we begin to study object-oriented development - how objects and functions work, what is the context of the call and how it is transmitted.

One of the most confused mechanisms in JavaScript is the this keyword. It's a special identifier keyword that's automatically defined in the scope of every function, but what exactly it refers to bedevils even seasoned JavaScript developers.

> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. -- Arthur C. Clarke

JavaScript's this mechanism isn't actually that advanced, but developers often paraphrase that quote in their own mind by inserting "complex" or "confusing", and there's no question that without lack of clear understanding, this can seem downright magical in your confusion.

#### <i class="icon-star"></i> `this` keyword
Magic word `this`... Uh, you'll fall in love with it exactly then when you'll understand it.
In most cases, the value of `this` is determined by how a function is called. It can be set by assignment during execution, and it may be different each time the function is called. 

*What you'll learn:*

 1. What is `this`keyword?
 2. Access to the object from objects method
