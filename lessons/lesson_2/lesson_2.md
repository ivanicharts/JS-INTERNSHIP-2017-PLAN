Lesson 2 - Functions, dive into numbers and strings
------------------------------------------------------------


Hi there! In this lesson you will learn functions and all stuff around them - recursion, call stack and so on. Also we'll dive into primitives - numbers and strings. Keep your mind sharp, it is very important lesson. Good luck!

#### <i class="icon-star"></i> Functions
It is usual thing when we need to repeat some actions in many other parts of a program. 
For example just to print some welcome message for a user, or when user leaves the site, or somewhere else.
In order not to repeat same code in many places, functions are invented. Functions are main "building blocks" of a program.

*What you'll learn:*

 1. What is a function?
 2. How to create your own function?
 3. What is "local" and "external" variables?
 4. What is function arguments?
 5. The "return" directive
 6. Invoking functions
 7. Function scope

#### <i class="icon-star"></i> Recursion, stack
This topic is not actually refers to the JavaScript, but it very important to understand what is recursion and stack. Every programmer must know it!

*What you'll learn:*

 1. What is recursion and how to implement your own
 2. What is call stack
 3. What is execution context

#### <i class="icon-star"></i> Dive into Numbers
You have already met numbers in JavaScript, but now we'll dive into them much deeper. In this topic you'll learn everything you need to know about *Numbers*.

*What you'll learn:*

 1. What is `NaN` and `Infinity`
 2. How works conversion to number and how to use it
 3. `toString()` with numbers
 4. How to round numbers
 5. `toFixed()`
 6. `Math` object - methods and properties

#### <i class="icon-star"></i> Dive into Strings
It is very important to know how to work with string - cut them on slices, trim and concatenate them back. Like with previous topic - here you'll learn everything about *Strings*

*What you'll learn:*

 1. Special characters and escaping them
 2. Methods and properties: `length`, `toUpperCase()`, `indexOf()`, `slice()`, etc.
 3. Strings comparison
 4. `String` object
