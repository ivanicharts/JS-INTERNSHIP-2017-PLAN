You have two variables, that are declared:
```
var Hello;
var five;
```
Below those variables is an alert function, that will take a string and show it to you in a dialog window.
Now when code executes, browser will show a message: **Word "undefined" contains undefined letters.**
But that makes no sense, right? So your task is to assign some values to those variables above.
So the variable `Hello` should contain the string "hello" and the variable five should contain a number `5`.
